        <h1>Meta</h1>
        <h2>Purpose</h2>
        <p>
            Thank you for your interest in joining our team. We need to evaluate
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>how well candidates can think and meta-think about problems they are presented with</li>
            <li>how proficient the candidates are at building large-scale software systems, in terms of</li>
            <ul>
                <li>scalability in terms of software design</li>
                <li>scalability in terms of function-level performance</li>
                <li>scalability in terms of readability and maintainability</li>
            </ul>
            <li>how careful/caring the candidates are</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Completing this take-home question will give us the data points we need to make this
            evaluation. Thank you for the time you put into building the solution.
        </p>

        <p>
            We strongly encourage you to read in full and understand the Chaldal Engineering Standards
            document <code>engineering-standards.html</code>, and adjust your problem solving and
            coding approach to match the criteria we'll be evaluating you on.
        </p>

        <h1>Task</h1>
        <p>
            Build a program to analyze app usage data for a hypothetical menu planning calendar app.
            On any day, a user can plan multiple meals, and each meal may have multiple dishes. The
            program you build will analyze how engaged users are with the app.
        </p>

        <h2>Style</h2>
        <p>
            There are many ways to write such a program. When choosing your style, imagine that you are
            building a system that will evolve to handling many more features in the very near future,
            so structure your code in a way that would support such a future.
        </p>

        <h2>Language</h2>
        <p>
            Use a language of your choice. Include instructions to get from unzipping to runnable state,
            including details of what OS/version your code is meant to be run on.
        </p>
        <p class="secondary">
            NOTE: Some candidates chose to code their solution in "the language I've wanted to play with for a
            while but never had a chance to". We do not recommend this. We want to see the candidate's coding
            skills (naming, layout, design, readability, use of libraries, idioms, best practices) at their
            absolute best, and using a new and unfamiliar language is unlikely to produce optimal results,
            unless the candidate spends far more time on this question (to learn the language well) than we
            are comfortable asking for.
        </p>

        <h2>Data</h2>
        <p>
            In the <code>./data</code> folder, you will find a bunch of files in the form <code>userId.json</code>.
            They contain app data for a bunch of users. The structure should be fairly obvious upon examination.
        </p>

        <h2>Output</h2>
        <p>
            <code class="block">
            ./dist/run active 2016-09-01 2016-09-08
        </code>
        <p>
            should result in a list of comma- separated user ids that were “active” during the specified period,
            where “active” means they had at least 5 meals.
        </p>
        <code class="block">
            ./dist/run superactive 2016-09-01 2016-09-08
        </code>
        <p>
            should result in a list of comma- separated user ids that were “super-active” during the specified
            period, which means they had more than 10 meals.
        </p>
        <code class="block">
            ./dist/run bored 2016-09-01 2016-09-08
        </code>
        <p>
            should result in a list of comma- separated user ids that were “bored” during the specified period,
            meaning that they were “active” in the preceding period, but didn’t make the “active” threshold in
            the specified period.
        </p>

        <h2>Assumptions</h2>
        <p>
            Please explicitly state any assumptions you make.
        </p>

        <h2>Clarifications</h2>
        <p>
            Feel free to email for clarifications if something is unclear.
        </p>

        <h2>Submission</h2>
        <p>
            Please submit a tarball containing the code, data, build instructions, and whatever else
            you deem necessary to help us reach our stated evaluation goals.
        </p>

        <h2>Expected Amount of Work</h2>
        <p>
            We expect this work to be completed in about 3 to 4 hours. If it starts looking like it will take
            longer than that, possibly your coding speed is slower than we were hoping for. Speed is only one
            facet of building software, and we’d love to evaluate as many facets as we can in this exercise,
            but do not want to cost you any more time beyond what we expect and thus consider reasonable.
        </p>

        <p>
            So, if 2 hours into it you think you’ll run way overtime, please cut scope, in a way that maximizes
            your chance of demonstrating the things listed in the “purpose” section of this document. Having
            some runnable code is better than having a bunch of code that doesn’t run.
